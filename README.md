# ioStarterReact
A starter project for examples on [ioRecipes.com](https://iorecipes.com/). 

Feel free to use this to create your own examples and publish them on [ioRecipes.com](https://iorecipes.com/).

## How to Use This Project
* Add any minimal code to the "Begin" part so that users who are trying to work through your example don't need to-do. This is anything that's not relevant to the actual tutorial/example/recipe. This should just be the scaffolding that the reader of your recipe needs.
* Copy over the Begin contents to the "Complete" folder and do all your coding there are you're writing your recipe. That is, The complete folder should have the complete, working project in your example.
